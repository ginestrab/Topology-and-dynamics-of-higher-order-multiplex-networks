# Topology-and-dynamics-of-higher-order-multiplex-networks

This repository contains 4 MATLAB codes to investigate the spectral properties of the Multiplex Hodge Laplacian on random duplex networks with tunable link overlap.

1. Spectrum_delta_random_github.m
   Main code that generates visualization of the Fiedler eigenvalue of the up- and the down- Multiplex Hodge 1-Laplacians .
2.   random_duplex_overlap_github.m
   Code that generates the radom duplex network with tunable link overlap.
4.   read_github.m
   Code that reads the multiplex network and extracts the multilinks
6.   Fiedler_github.m
   Code that calculates the metric matrices, the Multiplex Hodge Laplacians and  the Fiedler eigevalues for the up- and down- Multiplex Hodge 1-Laplacian.
